# Desafio_Bolttech_API

Tests performed in the second stage of the process for the QAE function. I tried to develop mobile automation tests, but 
I was not successful. In the API challenge, I couldn't create all tests in REST Assured, but I was successful when creating 
in the postman, so I exported the collection and environments, put the validations in a tab tests and pre tests, I validated 
the status and return code of the message, I created the variables to facilitate their usability. So I apologize for not 
being complete the tests, but I dedicate myself to the maximum, and this is the best opportunity to develop my skills, I will 
train a lot. Thank you guys.
